What is TheShareGame
====================
TheShareGame is an online stock market simulation with its own market. Unlike other stock market simulations
this game is not coupled to the reality.

The **Players** make the market. The actions of players have an immediately impact on the market.

If a player registers they will be forced to created a new company. In the beginning the system holds all the shares,
which then get sold to the market.

The goal is to generate more money by investing so far there are two options - more to come, see :ref:`Roadmap:Roadmap`:

- Buy :ref:`Manual:shares` of other companies
- Buy :ref:`Manual:bonds`


How does the market grow?
------------------------
From an economic perspective there are two main sources that generate more money in the market
and hence create **Inflation**:


#. If a new player joins the game and creates a new company, the company will start with *1,000,000$* in cash.
#. Bonds are given out by the system. So if a company buys bonds, it will receive after a couple of days its invested money back as well as the interest rates. So on the return day, more money will circulate in the market.


**Deflation** currently only has own source in the game:

#. When a company joins the game, the system - Centralbank - will sell all of the shares. So buying shares of a company which joined the game will result that the payed value will leave the circle of the market.


What is the goal?
----------------
There is no particular goal to be reached. Like any stock market everyone will try to accumulate as much liquidity as possible.
But it is up to you what you want to achieve or which strategies you want to try out.

In the end it only matters that you have fun and enjoy being part of the community.


Is it free to play?
-------------------
Yes, and it will continue to be free. If I cannot to manage pay the server costs from my own costs, I will create
an patreon account or enable Github sponsoring.
